# LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting 
This algorithm determines the L and U component of a square matrix. This requires a square matrix as an input. 
## Inputs:
  A - coefficient matrix
## Outputs:
  L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
  U - upper triangular matrix
  P - the pivot matrix
