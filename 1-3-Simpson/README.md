# Simpson 1/3 
This algorithm solves for the integration of a data set in array format. The independent variables must be equally spaced. If there are is an even number of data points, a single trap rule will be utilized. 
##  Inputs
  x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
  y = the vector of function values with respect to x
## Outputs:
  I = the numerical integral calculated
